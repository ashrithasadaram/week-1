 a predictive model that estimates future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for various industry sectors or organizations, using historical emission records and influential economic factors. 
  Key Data Sources
    - Historical emission data (e.g., from government databases or NGOs)
    - Sector-wise GDP, energy consumption, and production metrics
    - Economic indicators: inflation, growth rate, carbon pricing
    - External datasets: weather patterns, regulatory changes, industrial policies
 Tech Stack & ML Workflow
    - Languages/Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost or LightGBM
    - Data Processing: Handling missing values, normalization, feature engineering (sector trends, carbon intensity, policy changes)
 Key Insights for Modeling
 This data allows you to:
    - Normalize emissions relative to economic value per sector
    - Forecast future emissions by multiplying predicted economic output per sector with respective emission factors
    - Account for sector-specific gas composition‚Äîfor example:
    - üöõ Truck transportation has high CO‚ÇÇ (1.315 kg/USD)
    - ‚ö° Utilities dominate with 3.425 kg/USD CO‚ÇÇ‚Äîhigh-impact sector
    - üõ¢Ô∏è Oil & gas extraction shows mixed emissions (CO‚ÇÇ, CH‚ÇÑ, etc.)
    - Incorporate DQ indicators to weigh data reliability in your model (e.g., regression weighting or Bayesian priors)
